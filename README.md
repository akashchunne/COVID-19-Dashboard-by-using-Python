Project Overview: Interactive COVID-19 Dashboard
This project is an interactive web-based dashboard designed to visualize the Coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic data. It presents key statistics in an easily digestible format and allows
users to explore different facets of the data through dynamic charts and graphs. The primary
goal is to provide a clear, at-a-glance understanding of the pandemic's impact using
state-wise daily data.
The dashboard is built using Python with the Dash framework, leveraging Plotly for creating
interactive visualizations and Pandas for efficient data manipulation
